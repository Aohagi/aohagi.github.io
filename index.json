They are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:\n\r“Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”\r“Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions”\r\r\rSome Data Exploration\rHere, I will explore the data and then show correlations between the outcome variable, i.e. mpg and the transmission variable as predictor.

Error t value Pr(\u0026gt;|t|)\r(Intercept) 17.15 1.12 15.25 1.13e-15\ram1 7.24 1.76 4.11 2.85e-04\rInterpreting the Model Output\rThe intercept says that the average miles per gallon of an automatic automobile is 17.147 and our slope shows the mean difference of the two transmissions. That means, on average, the mpg of manual automobiles are 7.245 more than automatic ones. However, the variation in the mpg that is explained by transmission is just 36%. So, this suggests we may need adjusting other variables for better modeling and prediction capabilities.\n\r\rModel Selection\rThere are many model selection techniques but here are the two I preferred to apply.\n1. Backward Selection\r## backward selection; we use the full model and it will remove the unnecessary ones\rfit.full \u0026lt;- lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars2)\rstep(fit.full, direction = \u0026quot;backward\u0026quot;)\rBackward selection produces just 3 out 10 variables for the model, They are transmission, weight and quarter mile time. These are going to be those I will use to fit the model.\n\r2. Best Subset Regression\r## loading leaps\rlibrary(leaps)\rpredictors_df \u0026lt;- subset(mtcars, select = -1)\rregsubsetsObj \u0026lt;- regsubsets(x = predictors_df, y = mtcars$mpg, nbest = 1, really.big = T)\rplot(regsubsetsObj, scale = \u0026quot;Cp\u0026quot;) # regsubsets plot based on Cp\rabline(h = 8, col = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;, lwd = 3)\rIt’s worth mentioning that this technique also outputs the same three variables. This is shown by the red horizontal line that touches the black bars corresponding to the three variables; i.e. am, wt and qsec.\n\r\rFitting Our New Model\r## fitting the model with transmission, weight and quarter mile time variables\rfit1 \u0026lt;- lm(mpg ~ am + wt + qsec, data = mtcars2)\rsummary(fit1)$coef\r Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(\u0026gt;|t|)\r(Intercept) 9.62 6.960 1.38 1.78e-01\ram1 2.94 1.411 2.08 4.67e-02\rwt -3.92 0.711 -5.51 6.95e-06\rqsec 1.23 0.289 4.25 2.16e-04\rNow, after we adjusted the model for weight and quarter mile time, we see that the slope coefficient changed its sign to negative. This means, on average, the manual automobiles have 2.94 mpg more than the automatics keeping the weight and quarter mile time constant. We also found as the weight increases by 1000 lbs we expect the mpg to decrease by 5.35 keeping transmission and qsec constant. All p-values for the three variables are less 0.05, this is a good indication that they are all important for the model. Moreover, the new model with am, wt and qsec variables as predictors explains 83% of the variation in the outcome variable; mpg.\nGetting Confidence Interval for the Parameters\r## the 95th confidence interval\rconfint(fit1, level=0.95)\r 2.5 % 97.5 %\r(Intercept) -4.6383 23.87\ram1 0.0457 5.83\rwt -5.3733 -2.46\rqsec 0.6346 1.82\rThe output says that we are 95% confident that manual transmission is better for mpg and the expected mpg is between 0.04 to 5.83, when using manual transmission.\n\rModel Comparison Using Anova\r## checking if our new model is the better that the old one with just transmission as predictor\r## using anova for nested models\rcat(\u0026quot;The P-value is:\u0026quot;, anova(fit0, fit1)$\u0026quot;Pr(\u0026gt;F)\u0026quot;[2])\rThe P-value is: 1.55e-09\rThe anova output gives us a p-value much smaller than the typical benchmark of type I error, i.e. 0.05. We can conclude that the new model better fits the data and adding weight and quarter mile time improves it’s quality. ## Evaluating the Assumptions of Multiple Regression\n## ploting the residuals\rpar(mfrow = c(2, 2))\rplot(fit1)\rAs shown above, there is no serious concern on assumptions violation. We can see the residual are almost normally distributed and there is no distinc pattern on residuals. The homoscedasticity assumption is also met as the residual variations seems to be constant around the mean. The residuals vs leverage plot shows that there are no potential outliers because all observation are within the cook’s distance.\n\rChecking Multicollinearity\r## using the car package for vif\rcar::vif(fit1)\r am wt qsec 2.54 2.48 1.36 \rVariance Inflation Factors (vif) is pretty less than the threshold of 10 for all the three variable: am, wt and qsec. This assures that the predictors in the model don’t seem to be correlated themselves.\n\r\rResidual Diagnostics\rHere, we will be performing some residual diagnostics and see if there are obsevations that have leverage and influence.\n## depicting dfbetas, dffits, and cook\u0026#39;s distance par(mfrow = c(3, 2))\rplot(dffits(fit1))\rplot(dfbetas(fit1)[,2])\rplot(dfbetas(fit1)[,3])\rplot(dfbetas(fit1)[,4])\rplot(cooks.distance(fit1))\rUsing dfbetas, dffits, and cook’s distance for residual diagnostics, It doesn’t seem that observations from transmission and weight variables have higher leverage or influence than others, so adding or removing some observations may not produce noticeable difference in our response or coefficients. However, in the quarter mile time observations, there is a point that is not well with the range of the other points and it’s possible it could be influential.\n\rAppendix\rFinally, the appendix of this report shows some exploratory graphs like correlation matrix.\n## loading the corrplot packages for visualizing the correlation matrix\rlibrary(corrplot)\rcorr \u0026lt;- cor(mtcars)\rcorrplot(corr)\rlibrary(ggplot2)\rg1 \u0026lt;- ggplot(mtcars2, aes(x = am, y = mpg)) + geom_boxplot(col = \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;, fill = \u0026quot;lightgreen\u0026quot;) +\rgeom_point() + theme_bw()\rg2 \u0026lt;- ggplot(mtcars2, aes(x = cyl, y = mpg, fill = cyl)) + geom_col(width = 0.6) +\rfacet_grid(am ~ .) + theme_bw()\rlibrary(gridExtra)\rgrid.arrange(g1, g2, ncol= 2)\r\r","date":1461704400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461704400,"objectID":"2246edb6142eaa66ab95729719522f41","permalink":"/project/reg/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/project/reg/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Peer-graded Assignment"],"title":"Regression Models Course Project","type":"project"},{"authors":["Abdirahman Omar Mohamoud"],"categories":null,"content":" Academic makes it easy to create a beautiful website for free using Markdown.

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging.
